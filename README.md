# vscode-dev-containers

A **development container** is a running [Docker](https://www.docker.com) container with a well-defined tool/runtime stack and its prerequisites. The [VS Code Remote - Containers](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/download/containers) extension and [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) allow you to open or clone code in a local or cloud-hosted dev container and take advantage of VS Code's full development feature set.

This repository contains a set of **dev container definitions** to help bootstrap my development process and get a containerized environment running quickly.
